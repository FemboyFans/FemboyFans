|:------|:------:|:------|
| [app/concerns/api_methods.rb](app/concerns/api_methods.rb#L27) | 27 | deprecated, shouldn't expose this as an instance method. |
| [app/concerns/api_methods.rb](app/concerns/api_methods.rb#L33) | 33 | deprecated, shouldn't expose this as an instance method. |
| [app/concerns/concurrency_methods.rb](app/concerns/concurrency_methods.rb#L8) | 8 | We may deadlock if a transaction is open; do a non-parallel each. |

### FIXMEs
| Filename | line # | FIXME |
|:------|:------:|:------|
| [app/controllers/artists_controller.rb](app/controllers/artists_controller.rb#L63) | 63 | This is a hack on top of a hack to ensure all of the other attributes are set before url_string to ensure there are no race conditions |
